            In the 21st century, the internet is no more a luxury; it has rather become a basic necessity for our living. It is now used by school-going children, college students, working men and women, homemakers, elders, etc. We all are dependent on the internet, and the first basic amenity we search for in every house is an internet connection. It is now needed in every sector and in every home. It builds a network between every corner of the world. Even if you are bored or lonely, you get a thousand reasons not to feel bored with the internet.
